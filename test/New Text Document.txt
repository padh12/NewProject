Add all your files to the repo:

$ git add *
Check to see that there are changes to be committed:

$ git status
You should see something like this:

# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
#
#   new file:   my_project.info
#   new file:   my_project.module
#
In this case, my_project.info and my_project.module are the files I have in my project.

Commit the files.

$ git commit -m "First commit"
